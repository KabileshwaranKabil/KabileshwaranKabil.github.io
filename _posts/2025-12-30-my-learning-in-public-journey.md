## Introduction
As a Computer Science undergraduate, I realized that learning alone is not enough. What truly improves understanding is the ability to explain concepts clearly. This blog is my attempt to document what I learn and make my thinking visible.

## Why Learning in Public?
Learning in public helps me:
- Reinforce concepts by writing them down
- Track my progress over time
- Improve technical communication
- Build consistency and discipline

Instead of keeping notes private, I decided to share them openly so others can learn alongside me.

## What I’ll Be Writing About
On this blog, I will regularly write about:
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Core Computer Science concepts
- Project development insights
- Mistakes I make and lessons I learn

Each post will focus on clarity rather than perfection.

## How I’ll Use This Blog
- Short notes for daily learnings
- Detailed explanations for important topics
- Honest reflections on my learning process

The goal is not to impress, but to **improve continuously**.

## What’s Next
My next posts will focus on fundamental topics in programming and data structures, starting with arrays and basic problem-solving patterns.

Thanks for reading.
