## Looking Back, Moving Forward

As 2025 comes to an end, I've realized that consistency is more important than intensity. This year taught me the value of showing up every day, even if progress seems small. Now, as I step into 2026, I'm setting clearer goals for my technical journey.

## Goals for 2026

### 1. Restart My DSA Journey in Java

I've decided to dedicate serious time to mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using Java. While I've worked with DSA before, I want to build a solid foundation with:

- **Core Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables
- **Algorithm Patterns**: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy
- **Problem Solving**: Regular practice on coding platforms and real-world applications


The goal is not just to solve problems, but to understand the *why* behind each algorithm and know when to apply them.

### 2. Start Learning AI Fundamentals

The AI boom is real, and I don't want to be left behind. My plan is to build a strong foundation in:

- **Mathematics for AI**: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, Statistics
- **Machine Learning Basics**: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Model Evaluation
- **Python for AI**: Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Deep Learning Concepts**: Neural Networks, Backpropagation, Common Architectures

I'm starting with fundamentals rather than jumping straight to large models. Understanding the basics will make advanced topics clearer.

## Why These Goals?

- **DSA in Java**: Strong problem-solving skills are the foundation of software engineering. Java gives me practice with OOP principles.
- **AI Fundamentals**: AI is transforming every field. Understanding it deeply will open new career opportunities and help me build smarter applications.

## My Commitment

I promise to:
- Document my learning journey on this blog
- Share code and solutions (both successes and failures)
- Stay consistent, even when progress feels slow
- Help others learning on the same path

## The Hope

I sincerely hope I can follow through on these plans. 2026 will be challenging, but I'm ready. The key is discipline and consistency—showing up every day, writing code, solving problems, and learning.

**Progress > Perfection.**

Let's make 2026 count.
