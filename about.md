## About Me

Hi, I'm **Kabileshwaran**, a Computer Science undergraduate committed to learning in public and building a strong foundation in core CS concepts.

## What I'm Doing

I'm documenting my daily learnings, solving algorithmic problems, and building projects to improve my technical skills. This blog serves as a public record of my progress, mistakes, and insights.

## Focus Areas

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Problem-solving patterns, complexity analysis, and optimization techniques
- **Computer Science Fundamentals**: Operating systems, databases, networking, and system design
- **Software Development**: Building real-world projects with clean, maintainable code
- **Technical Writing**: Explaining concepts clearly and documenting my learning process

## Why Learning in Public?

Writing forces me to think clearly, reinforce what I've learned, and fill gaps in my understanding. By sharing openly, I hold myself accountable and create a resource that others might find useful.

## My Journey

As a CS undergraduate, I realized that just coding and studying aren't enough. What truly improves understanding is the ability to explain concepts clearly to others. This blog is my attempt to:

- Reinforce concepts by writing them down
- Track my progress over time
- Improve technical communication skills
- Build consistency and discipline in my learning
- Create a reference for future me and others
